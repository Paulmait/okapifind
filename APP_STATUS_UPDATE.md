# ✅ OkapiFind - App Status Update

## 🎉 APP IS NOW WORKING!

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED & FUNCTIONAL
**URL:** https://okapifind.com

---

## 🐛 Issue Resolved

### Problem:
```
❌ ReferenceError: require is not defined
❌ React app failed to mount  
❌ Loading timeout after 10 seconds
```

### Root Cause:
Removed too many environment variables from webpack config in security improvements, breaking Firebase initialization.

### Solution Applied:
✅ Restored all required `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` environment variables
✅ Fixed webpack DefinePlugin configuration
✅ Properly configured Node.js module fallbacks
✅ Maintained security with domain restrictions

---

## 🔒 Security Status

### Is It Safe to Expose Firebase Config?

**YES** - When properly configured (which we have). Here's why:

#### Firebase API Keys Are NOT Secret Keys
- They're **identifiers**, not authentication secrets
- Designed to be public (included in mobile apps)
- Security enforced by Firebase Security Rules, not API key secrecy

#### Our Security Layers:
1. **API Key Restrictions** ✅
   - Restricted to okapifind.com domain
   - Restricted to app bundle IDs
   - Cannot be used from other domains

2. **Firestore Security Rules** ✅
   - Users must be authenticated
   - Can only access their own data
   - Write operations validated

3. **Firebase Authentication** ✅
   - Secure token-based auth
   - Google/Apple Sign-In
   - Email verification

4. **Backend API Proxies** ✅
   - Sensitive operations server-side
   - Admin operations protected
   - Service account never exposed

### What's Safe vs Unsafe:

**✅ SAFE to expose (properly restricted):**
- Firebase client config (API key, auth domain, project ID)
- Supabase anon key (restricted by RLS)
- Google Maps API key (domain restricted)
- Mapbox public token
- Sentry DSN

**❌ NEVER expose:**
- Firebase Admin SDK private key
- Supabase service role key
- Stripe secret key
- Database passwords
- JWT secrets
