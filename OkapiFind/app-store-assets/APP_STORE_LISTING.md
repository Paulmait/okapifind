### Notes for Reviewer
```
OkapiFind is a parking location app that helps users remember where they parked and navigate back to their car.

To test the app:
1. Allow location permissions when prompted
2. Tap "Save Parking" to save a location
3. Move away from that location
4. Tap "Find My Car" to get walking directions back

The app works best when tested outdoors with GPS signal. Indoor/simulator testing may have limited location accuracy.

No login required. In-app purchases are optional premium features.
