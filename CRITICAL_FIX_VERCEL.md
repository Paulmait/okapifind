# üö® CRITICAL: Your App is Broken - Here's How to Fix It

## The Problem

Your app shows: **"Configuration Required - Missing EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*"**

This is because **environment variables are NOT set in Vercel dashboard**.

## The Root Cause

Looking at your deployed build, I can see that `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` is being referenced in the code but returning `undefined`. This means webpack.config.js is trying to inject these variables, but they don't exist during the Vercel build.

## The Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Open https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your **okapifind** project
3. Click **Settings** tab
4. Click **Environment Variables** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Add These Variables (COPY FROM YOUR LOCAL .env)

Open your local file: `C:\Users\maito\okapifind\OkapiFind\.env`

For EACH variable below, copy its value from your `.env` file and add to Vercel:

#### Firebase (7 variables - REQUIRED)
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

#### Supabase (2 variables - REQUIRED)
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

#### Maps (1 variable - REQUIRED)
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

#### Google OAuth (1 variable - REQUIRED for sign-in)
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID
```

### Step 3: How to Add Each Variable

For EACH variable listed above:

1. Click **"Add New"** button
2. **Name**: Copy the exact variable name (e.g., `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`)
3. **Value**: Copy from your `.env` file (e.g., `AIzaSyD_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
4. **Environments**: Check **ALL THREE** boxes:
   - ‚úÖ Production
   - ‚úÖ Preview
   - ‚úÖ Development
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Repeat for NEXT variable

### Step 4: Verify You Added Them All

After adding all variables, you should see **11 variables minimum** in the Environment Variables list.

Each variable should show 3 tags: `Production` `Preview` `Development`

### Step 5: Force Redeploy WITHOUT Cache

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the **"..."** menu (three dots)
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. **IMPORTANT**: UNCHECK the box "Use existing build cache"
6. Click **"Redeploy"** button

### Step 6: Wait and Test

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
2. Open your deployed URL
3. You should NO LONGER see "Configuration Required"

## Quick Verification Checklist

- [ ] Opened Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Went to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- [ ] Added all 7 Firebase variables
- [ ] Added all 2 Supabase variables
- [ ] Added Mapbox token
- [ ] Added Google Web Client ID
- [ ] Each variable set for: Production + Preview + Development
- [ ] Count total: Should be **11 variables minimum**
- [ ] Redeployed WITHOUT cache
- [ ] App now loads without error

## Why This Happened

Your webpack.config.js tries to inject environment variables:

```javascript
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  'process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY': JSON.stringify(process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY),
  // ... more variables
})
```

But `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` is **undefined** during Vercel build because you haven't set it in Vercel dashboard.

When webpack tries to inject `undefined`, the built JavaScript contains:

```javascript
apiKey: undefined // ‚ùå BROKEN
```

Instead of:

```javascript
apiKey: "AIzaSyD_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" // ‚úÖ WORKING
```

## After Fixing

Your app will:
- ‚úÖ Load immediately
- ‚úÖ Show the map
- ‚úÖ Allow Google Sign-In
- ‚úÖ Save parking locations

## Still Broken After Adding Variables?

If you added all variables and redeployed but still see the error:

### Check 1: Verify variables are actually saved
Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables and count them. You should see at least 11.

### Check 2: Verify you unchecked "Use existing build cache"
The cache might contain the old broken build. Redeploy again with cache DISABLED.

### Check 3: Check build logs
1. Go to Deployments ‚Üí Latest deployment
2. Click "View Function Logs" or "Building"
3. Search for "EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
4. If it says "undefined", the variables aren't being loaded

### Check 4: Verify environment is Production
Make sure you set the variables for "Production" environment specifically.

## Need Help?

If still broken after following ALL steps:
1. Take a screenshot of your Vercel Environment Variables page
2. Show me how many variables you see
3. Verify ALL have Production+Preview+Development tags
4. Tell me what error you still see

---

**The fix is simple but critical: Just add the environment variables to Vercel dashboard.**

Without them, your app cannot connect to Firebase, Supabase, or maps - so it shows "Configuration Required".
